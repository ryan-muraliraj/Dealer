## Branches
The main branch contains deprecated version 0.1 code and functionality. The version 0.2 branch contains code and functionality currently being worked on, and the branch is completely functional on the WHX server.  

Once all of the original functionality is finished, 0.2 will be updated to work with any server, and will be merged into main.

For now branches are being created off of 0.2 and merged back into 0.2 once it has been verified it will not break the branch. The live bot "The Dealer" generally runs on the latest commit of the 0.2 branch.
