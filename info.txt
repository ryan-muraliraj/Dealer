bet class

this class will be the bet itself and store stuff such as 
the title of the bet, 
the bet's ID, 
the different outcomes of the bet, 
who is invested in what outcome, 
the total amount of money for each outcome

this class will need to have methods such as
creating outcomes (a list ?)
deleting outcomes
adding people to outcomes
adding a balance/int to outcomes
returning a list of odds where odds are relative to position of outcomes
return a list of people subscribed to an outcome 

might be easier if you make a class for outcome
